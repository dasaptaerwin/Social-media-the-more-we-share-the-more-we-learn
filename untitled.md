> Social media is like a magnet that can draw attention to our research. 

One day I received an email from a researcher who is living in Japan. He said there's something wrong with my supplementary data set which was published in a paper in 2014. Apparently there was a miss-location in the coordinates. Another day, I received email from a fellow researcher from UK asking for my availability to be the co-PI of a proposal. Both researchers said they know me and my work from social media. **I even got invited for a coffee science-talk from a "mention" on Twitter**. 

> Social media makes what once a closed-loop to be more open. 

Although Indonesia is the 4<sup>th</sup> most populated country in the world, doesn't make our research have more impact, mostly due to language barrier and limited network. **For years we tend to do research as personal or organizational event, no more and no less**. Nevertheless out of that manner, we demand acknowledgment, citations, and better yet we use that citation counts to judge who's more prominent than others. Research had been placed as a closed-loop activity, with no attention form others except the team member itself. More and more research will ended up as closed report and then locked up in somebody's drawers or some dusty shelves in a locked library. Social media could be the answer we've been looking for. And we are sure it is the answer we've been looking for. 

> Social media opens more doors of opportunity

Before we know and use social media, as academics living in a developing country, we suffered from brain drain, lack of ideas, lack of facilities, and closed network. Today, we can harvest ideas in a snap, add some thoughts, and having more ideas in return. Not only from our same side of the world, but the other side too. We read more science than ever before and learn from it and disseminate it even more. Borrowing [@Thesiswhisperer](www.twitter.com/thesiswhisperer) 's words **"When I read the tweets of others I consume their thoughts and ideas"**. 

> Social media attracts more scientific-generousity

So you might ask what did we and so many others do on social media. Did we just create and respond to random posts or chats, spend more time on it than on our real work, the one we get paid for? No, we only share what we know and re-tweet other's that we thought would be valuable for our followers. Nothing more. We don't brag (or [humblebrag](https://theresearchwhisperer.wordpress.com/2016/08/09/lets-talk-about-the-humblebrag/)) about what we do, we just letting others know what we have achieved, and what we have not due to many obstacles -- the ones we know of and the ones we don't. **A kind soul would step forward and tell you what's wrong with your work and how you can get it more sound**.    

> Social media multiplies learning curve

Many times, we just send out words. We don't know who read nor knowing who would deeply care about them, but instead they just pop out and send us their opinions, corrections, and inputs to expand and to enrich our work, to be more valuable for the society. On the other hand, simplest rule of nature applies, "you reap what you sow". __Social media is a giant take and give spyder web__. We must offer others for solutions, instant help, or just send our sincere and deepest sympathy. **And especially in our case as healthy and breathing academics, the more we share the more we learn**. Isn't it the way we should live our life?
