One day I received an email from a researcher who is living in Japan. He said there's something wrong with my supplementary data set which was published in a paper in 2014. Apparently there was a miss-location in the coordinates. Another day, I received email from a fellow researcher from UK asking for my availability to be the co-PI of a proposal. Both researchers said they know me and my work from social media. *I even got invited for a coffee science-talk from a "mention" on Twitter*.

Before we know and use social media, as academia living in a developing country we suffered from brain drain, lack of ideas, lack of facilities, and closed network. Today, we can harvest ideas in a snap, add some thoughts, and having more ideas in return. We read more science than ever before and learn from it and share it even more. Borrowing [@Thesiswhisperer](www.twitter.com/thesiswhisperer) 's words "When I read the tweets of others I consume their thoughts and ideas". *For us, social media has opened more doors of opportunity*. 

So you might ask what did I and so many others do on social media. Did we just create a random chat, spend more time on it than on our real work, the one we get paid for? No, we only share what we know and re-tweet other's that we thought would be valuable for our followers. Nothing more. We don't brag about what we do, we just letting others know what we have achieved, and what we have not due to many obstacles -- the ones we know of and the ones we don't. *A kind soul would step forward and tell you what's wrong with your work and how you can get it more sound*.    

Many times, we just send out words. We don't know who read our post nor knowing who would deeply care about it, but instead they just pop out and send us their opinions, corrections, and inputs to expand and to enrich our work, to be more valuable for society. On the other hand, simplest nature rule applies, "you reap what you sow". __Social media is a giant take and give spyder web__. We offer others for solutions, instant help, or just send our sincere and deepest sympathy.
